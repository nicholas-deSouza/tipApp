**Tip App ** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Nicholas de Souza**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

- [ ] Created a settings page
- [ ] Created a split slider for up to 30 individuals
- [ ] Changed the overall look of the app

## Notes

This was my first time using both Swift and Xcode; it was also the first time I had ever done a mobile app so at first glance this was a challenge but I spent time researching how to implement different functionalities and I feel as though this led me to becoming a lot more comfortable overall with app development.
